I'm glad you are here. I plan to create my first completed website on GitHub and hopefully give an indepth summary of myself and what interests my ever depleting brain. I am a 24 and still wondering when I will grow a full beard I also enjoy listening to music it helps me put a time on a memory. some of my favorite artists are Kid Cudi, Flume, and Playboi Carti, but i have a wide variety of taste. I would love to collect art once I am financially competent. That is it for now.
